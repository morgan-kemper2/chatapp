# chatapp
This chat application for mobile devices will use React Native, Gifted Chat, and Google Firebase.

Features will include:

A "Start" screen that will allow the user to choose their username and the chat screen background color.
This will lead to a "Chat" screen that will allow the user to send and receive text messages, images from their camera and image gallery, and send location data displayed on a map view. The image and location data will require permission from the user in order to be used in this app.
All messages will be stored in Google Firebase Cloud Storage.
Users will also have access to their previously sent and received messages offline.


Building this app:

To build this app, you will need Expo, your smart phone, and an Android or iOS emulator.

Begin by creating an account with Expo at https://expo.io/signup
Then install Expo using the command 'npm install --global expo-cli' in your device's terminal. Follow up with the command 'npm install' to ensure you've installed your application's dependencies.

Next you'll need to create a new project by using the command 'expo init 'project title'', you'll be asked which template to use for this project. Select the blank template.

Once setup is complete, navigate into the folder for your project using the command 'cd 'project title''. Then start expo using the command 'expo start'.

A window will open in your browser, ensure that your smart phone and computer are on the same network (Lan or Wifi) and open Expo on your phone. Your project should be listed under "Recently in Development". If your project isn't listed, scan the QR code provided in your browser or terminal. If you are unable to scan it, you can click the "Send link with email" option.

Once these steps are complete, you'll receive a screen on your phone or emulator stating "Open up App.js to start working on your app!"

You can then begin writing your code.
